== Solution Strategy

To reduce the workload and boost the quality of Shmoose, the client should be build on already existing and prooven components. A XMPP library is used to handle most of the implementation details of the main XEP's, needed by a modern client. Additional all the encryption stuff will not be implemented from scratch but also used from already existing libraries.



TODO
Map the quality goals to the implementation details
